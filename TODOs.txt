A List of things to add or improve
----------------------------------

* read_config_file():
  Better modularize the config file scan so it doesn't need 
  to be done multiple times, while also making it easy to 
  retrieve/use the right config option, i.e., be able to 
  provide the function the specific field(s) you are looking
  for and have the function return only that value
* parent_get_oauth_secret():
  Clean up the nasty hacks used to pull in all the oauth goo
* parent_copy_cert_local(), child_copy_cert():
  Find a nice way to use ssh keys so we don't have to copy
  the cert locally just to redeploy on target capsule
